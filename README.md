# 📝 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 - 𝐀 𝐌𝐄𝐑𝐍 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭! 📝

> - I'm excited to my latest project, iNotebook. What sets iNotebook apart is its distinctive approach - the backend and frontend are developed and deployed separately, providing enhanced flexibility and efficiency.

> - 🌐 The backend, crafted with precision using the MEN (MongoDB, Express.js and Node.js) stack, is designed to seamlessly handle data operations, ensuring a robust foundation for our application.

> 🚀 On the frontend, we've harnessed the power of React to deliver a dynamic and user-friendly interface. But here's the twist - the frontend communicates with the backend through a set of APIs, creating a 
    decoupled architecture that amplifies scalability and maintainability.

#### 📑 Features that make iNotebook shine:
    - ✨ Add notes effortlessly with title, description, and tags.
    - 🔄 Your password is saved with hashing
    - 🚀 Deployed backend API for enhanced performance.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
